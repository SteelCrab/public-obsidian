> Managing the Obsidian MD document editor using a remote repository

## Overview

While managing documentation, I suddenly realized that utilizing Obsidian and GitHub would be a convenient way to manage documents, so I created a new repo.

The branching feature allows me to split up each separate document, and if nodes need to be connected, I believe merging will allow for integrated management. I expect to focus on Obsidian-centric documentation in the second half of the year.
I chose "PUBLIC" to ensure document autonomy. I hope others will find inspiration in reading my documentation.
